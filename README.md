# Multi-Connection Chat

**Course:** CS 346 — Fall 2020  
**Author:** Kevin Tieu

## Overview

A chat system with a Windows Forms GUI client and a multi-threaded server. Supports concurrent connections with separate ports for authentication, sending, and receiving messages.

## What the Program Does

The server listens on three ports:

1. Authentication (username and password, length-prefixed UTF-8).
2. Write channel for outgoing messages.
3. Read / broadcast channel for incoming messages.

The client has a login form and a main chat window. The server uses separate threads for the authenticator, receiver, and broadcasters.

## Files

| `Server.cs` | Server core |
